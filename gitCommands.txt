HOW TO CREATE A GITIGNORE
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10744305/how-to-create-gitignore-file

I used powershell new-item -type file -name .gitignore
notepad .gitignore
add the file you wish to ignore
save
commit the change to .gitignore

git status
	if the file is being tracked, remove it:
git rm --cached LCDMadness/App.config


Create the text file gitignore.txt
Open it in a text editor and add your rules, then save and close
Hold SHIFT, right click the folder you're in, then select Open command window here
Then rename the file in the command line, with ren gitignore.txt .gitignore
